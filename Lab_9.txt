LAB 9
CS545 â€“ React (Hooks update)

Based on your previous lab, update the following

-	Make the selected id for post a global value by using useContext()
-	Make the NewPost form sent with useRef()

Optional

-	Make the Comment components render only when you render the PostDetails, it should not re-render unless the selected post (selected id) changes.
